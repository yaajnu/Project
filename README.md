Task 2 Heroku website:https://arcane-shelf-69861.herokuapp.com/ Takes a few seconds to open 

Saved model link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B2CVH687SBntDT-YICGSyjHtyoJJHph-/view?usp=sharing

Trained a random forest regressor(as well as a svr and linear regression) on the data and made a heroku website using streamlit(for random forest ,i.e,the best model) for making predictions


And to run the model locally just run the command streamlit run model.py after downloading the saved models.
